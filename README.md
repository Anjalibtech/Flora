    <p>Flora is all the plant life present in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring (indigenous) native plants</p>
    <h2>Endangered</h2>
    <p>Endangered species, any species that is at risk of extinction because of a sudden rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its critical habitat.Endangered plant species can be found all over the world. No matter where they are located, they all share one common factor that is thought to have put them onto the endangered list. None of these plants, flowers or trees is thought to have any commodity value to the human race. They may have in an early era, but their lack of usefulness has not encouraged efforts to promote conservation.</p>
    <h3>5 most Endangered Flora</h3>
    <h4>1.Baobab Tree</h4>
    <p>This tree is an unusual life giving tree. While it may only sprout leafs for 3 months of the year, it stores water in its broad and twisted trunk. The peoples of Madagascar, Africa and India would often build their homes among its roots to survive the dry seasons. Climate change, and over development have destroyed its natural habitat.</p>

    <h4>2.Monkey Puzzle Tree</h4>
    <p>Native to Chile, it seems odd that the national tree would be on the endangered list, but development and loss of its natural habitat have harmed its wild growth. It was also collected as a popular yard ornament too. Fortunately, it does grow well in conservation, but also is not a high priority endangered plant.</p>

    <h4>3.Dragon Tree</h4>
    <p>These are the large and striking trees that form many people’s images of the African savanna. The trees can grow for thousands of years. As old as they can get, they are no match for severe drought, climate change and development. They are steadily disappearing from the continent</p>

    <h4>4.Bois Dentelle</h4>
    <p>Few people are aware of the existence of this delicate plant with the hanging white blossoms. It has never been highly valued as a commodity, and outside of Mauritius, it is rarely spoken of. The cloud forest where it grows has been invaded by many species of plants that are crowding out this small flower. The Bois Dentelle is one part of what makes the natural world beautiful that is steadily being crowded out.</p>

    <h4>5.Cork</h4>
    <p>This oak tree type is the tree where wine corks, and other items made from cork materials come from. While many environmentalists believed that advocating for alternative wine-stoppers would save cork, the reduced demand for the tree bark has instead begun to cause its demise. With no demand for the bark as a commodity, there is no interest in preserving its habitat or the tree itself.</p>

    <h3>Reasons of endangerement</h3>
    <p>Roughly 99 percent of threatened species are at risk because of human activities alone. The principal threats to species in the wild are:Although some of these hazards occur naturally, most are caused by human beings and their economic and cultural activities. The most pervasive of these threats is habitat loss and degradation—that is, the large-scale conversion of land in previously undisturbed areas driven by the growing demand for commercial agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development.</p>
    <h2>Extinct </h2>
    <p>Extinction is the termination of a kind of organism or of a group of kinds (taxon), usually a species.Extinction of a particular plant species occurs when there are no more individuals of that species alive anywhere in the world - the species has died out. This is a natural part of evolution.</p>
    <h3>5 Extinct Flora</h3>
    <h4>1.Lepidodendron</h4>
    <p>Also known as Scale tree, Lepidodendron was a part of the coral forest area. The name Lepidodendron comes from the Greek lepido, scale, and dendron, tree. It was a giant herb that grew up to 100 feet sometimes. The branches were conical in shape. They did not have seeds. Instead, they reproduced through Spores. By the end of the Mesozoic era, these plants died out.</p>

    <h4>2.Calamites</h4>
    <p>Calamites were medium sized trees that grew in the Carboniferous era. They had hollow stems, and the leaves and the branches were in whorls. They also reproduced through the formation of spores.</p>

    <h4>3.Archaefructus</h4>
    <p>Archaefructus are considered to be one of the oldest flowering plants. They belonged to the  Cretaceous age and were densely available in the northern regions of China. These flowering plants, however, lacked sepals or petals, and their reproductive organs were based on the stem of the plant.</p>

    <h4>4.Cooksonia</h4>
    <p>Cooksonia were primarily land plants known to have existed on earth about 425 million years ago. They thrived in the present regions of Australia and Britain. They were small and lacked leaves, flowers and roots. They only had slender stalks.</p>

    <h4>5.Rhynia</h4>
    <p>Rhynia were vascular plants that existed hundreds of years ago and belonged to the bryophytes category of plants. They were bisexual in nature and grew close to the other vascular plants.</p>

    <h3>Reasons of Extinction</h3>
    <p>. The main reasons for plant extinction in both groups of regions are agriculture and urbanization. In hotspot regions, one more threat caused plant extinction were biological invasions of plants and animals penetrated to new habitats and often caused harm to local flora and fauna. In biodiversity coldspots, changes in the hydrological regime of habitats (such as new dams that negatively affect the functioning of water bodies) may also cause plant extinctions.</p>
